# CrowdSafe

### Requirements: 
- MacBook running the latest version of macOS
- The latest version of Xcode 

 ### Important Details: 
- The dataset in use tracked occupants within a building from 8:00 am - 9:00 pm on weekdays and 10:00 am - 4:00 pm on weekends. Therefore, running our application outside of these time frames will definitely result in an empty room with 0 occupants. For best results in viewing the live capabilities of our application, please run our application within these time frames. Thanks.

 ### Instructions: 
1. Navigate to the “iOS Project” directory in our repo
2. Open “CrowdSafe.xcworkspace” using Xcode
3. At the top of Xcode, you will see a play and stop button. To the right of the stop button, make sure you see “CrowdSafe > iPhone 11”. If you do not see this, please click on this and make the appropriate selections.
4. Press “Command + R” on your keyboard or click the play button at the top left of the Xcode application. Please allow several minutes for the app and simulator to build. 
5. Once the simulator builds, you will be presented with a map and prompted to select a location. Click on the pin, then click on the blue info button on the right side of the pop up. 
6. You should now be at the main menu. If there are not 4 heat zones on the map, please allow for the app to complete loading. 
7. Once the heat maps have appeared, you can click on each zone to reveal the number of occupants in that zone. Clicking on exit plan will direct you to the building exit plan. Clicking on the refresh button will refresh the app, although the app will automatically refresh every 60 seconds.
